#Device stats app
 
For app developers and testers to quickly and easily display and share device information and statistics. Simple enough for the client to use ;)  

Created initially as I was looking into some security hardening techniques and found some older Android devices and more recent Chinese devices didn't support the crypto algorithms and SSL Cipher suites I was expecting.
